## vim

To use the .vimrc, first run
`git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`

Afterwards, open vim, dismiss the error by hitting <Return> and type `:BundleInstall`.
Once complete, close vim by typing `:qall`. Now all plugins should be active and no
more error should appear on startup.
